- Work in Progress

Hi, My name is Ivan Medrano-Velazquez. I joined the team as a contractor in March 2021 and since then I have:

- Led the way on migrating our volume processes out of Foundry and onto Databricks. This was the first full project that the Legend team moved out of foundry, you can see the spike back in April/May when the bulk of the code made it onto the new tech stack. This process is still in use and was utilized by the business as late as January for some last minute changes to their planning process. Regardless the number of contributions has cratered due to the application being resiliant and generic enough for re-use. The business planned a 5 and 10 year plan application, I was told that the current infrastructure was going to be re-used as it did everything they needed without further development.
